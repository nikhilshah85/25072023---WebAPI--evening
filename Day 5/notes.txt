WebPI Developer
	a. Create webapi
	b. Consume WebAPI in your front application (Make a get call, display data in a table, 							Put,post,delete)
		two ways to consume 
		 1. Client side calls - fetch api for the same - standard built into every browser
			This is the fastest - but less secure for critical data calls
		 2. Sever Side - HttpClient class - a class for safe calls
			This is safest - bit slower than above one


----------------------------------
	fetch api - standard by W3C and part of every Modern browser
	this is asyn in nature 
	this returns a promise - which is good for end user


	fetch( url ).then( responseDataType)
		   .then( data => { code to display data }
		   .catch (err => { code to display error }
